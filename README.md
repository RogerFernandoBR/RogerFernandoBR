### About me
Hello! My name is Roger and I'm a web developer with over 6 years of experience in web development and 15 years in the IT industry. My main skills include JavaScript, Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, GIT, Azure Dev Ops, Node, MongoDB, PHP, MySQL, APIs, SVN, VueJS, Laravel and React. I have extensive experience in manipulating npm libraries for package and dependency management in web projects. Currently, I'm working as an Angular developer and leading a team in the development of a design system framework for my company. I've worked on full-stack development projects in the past, but now I'm focused on front-end development. My previous projects include the development of responsive web applications, APIs, and customized solutions to meet specific client needs. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills. If you need an experienced and dedicated web developer for your team, please feel free to contact me, and let's work together to make your vision a reality!
